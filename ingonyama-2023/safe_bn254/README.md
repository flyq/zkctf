## solution description
In layman's terms, this question is about how to calculate the private key based on the public key, that is, solving ECDLP. Of course, only incorrect curve parameters can be completed with existing computing power.

The ECDLP problem, generally regarded as computationally infeasible, hinges on the order of the subgroup of the elliptic curve. The curve should have a large prime order subgroup, as operations are conducted in this group. If the subgroup's order is small, the [Pohlig-Hellman algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pohlig%E2%80%93Hellman_algorithm) can be used to fragment the problem into smaller, solvable parts. These parts can then be pieced back together using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to arrive at the final solution.
